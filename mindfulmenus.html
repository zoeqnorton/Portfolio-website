    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <p>
        WHO are you designing for? 
        Designing an app for everyone in the kitchen wether they are beginners or experienced. Also including options for people with dietary restrictions and intolerances.
    
        WHAT kinds of tasks and goals will your audience be accomplishing as they use your website or app? 
        Users will be able to search for particular recipes. Written instructions, photos and video guides will be available for assistance.
        
        WHEN will your audience be engaging with your product? 
        The user will engage with the product before they cook, while they are cooking, and after they cook. As well as while they are in the supermarket shopping for ingredients, or in their spare time browsing for recipes.
        
        WHERE will your audience be using what you are designing ? 
        Users will engage with the app in their own home, their family or friends home, and the supermarket. They can engage on several different devices being phone, tablet, or desktop.
        
        WHY is your audience choosing to use what you have designed?
         • The product will be easy to use and beginner friendly. The user will be able to search for recipes specifically catered to their own dietary needs and restrictions. The user will have access to a web app and mobile app that are both free to use.</p>

</div>
<div>
    <h2>User Interviews</h2>
    <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
    <p>I am looking to prove that everyone can enjoy their experience via a recipe app. People with dietary restrictions, people looking for quick and easy recipes and people who are looking for budget friendly meals will all be able to engage with the app with success.</p>
 <div>
<div>
    <h4>Questions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Do you have any dietary restrictions, do you know anyone with dietary restrictions </li>
        <li>•Does the pricing of ingredients have a factor in how you decide your meals, if so please explain. </li>
        <li>When looking up recipes what challenges have you faced</li>
        <li>What information and features would you like to see on a recipe app</li>

    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>Feedback</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Participants look for more budget friendly options when cooking. </li>
        <li>Frustrations with the need to be more clear and concise in the step by step instructions.</li>
        <li>Participants want video tutorials and guides to walk them through the recipes</li>
        <li>Participants would like to see specific brands of ingredients suggested on the app</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Exploratory Sketching</h2>
    <p>The Crazy 8s method was performed to help create low fidelity wireframes.  This method helped speed up my design process because of the time constraint. Using this method the designer must spend only 1 minute on each screen in the wireframes sketching process. I felt that in the past I have become caught up on a single screen for too long and with this process it helped expedite the design to become low-fidelity wireframes much quicker.</p>
<div>
<h2>Wireframing</h2>
<picture><img src="img/images/lowfiwireframes.jpg" alt="Lowfi Wireframes"></picture>
<p>Based off the Low-Fi wireframes I was able to make the appropriate changes to my screens and test out other options in the design process for Mid- fidelity wireframes. The mid- Fidelity wireframes show changes such as CTA action boxes being added, reviews left by other users and showcases a more fine tuned product ready to be turned into high- Fidelity wireframes.</p>
<picture><img src="img/images/midfi.jpg" alt="Midfi Wireframes"></picture>

<p>Using my Mid-fidelity wireframes I was able to create my High-fidelity wireframes using the style guide and all the changes implemented from user testing.</p>

</div>
<div>
    <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
    <p>The goal of this exercise is to observe the users, and their ability to navigate the app for the first time. The users will be given three specific tasks to complete and will be observed while doing so in hopes of collecting information on pain points and what the user enjoyed about the app. This will help with further development of the web app.</p>
    <h3>Tasks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You open the app and signup for an account, once signed up you will find a recipe and leave a review on one once chosen. </li>
        <li>You open the app and continue as a guest, find a recipe you would like to choose by browsing the available recipes </li>
        <li>You open the app and log in as if you are a returning guest, search for a recipe, and find the video guide tutorial to watch, then return to the home page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Using the feedback provided from the users during their task, I was able to compile results synthesis and error ratings for issues they found in the design.</h4>
        <div>
            <h5>Issues</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Two participants found the hamburger icon confusing, but once explained they had no issues </li>
                <li>One participant found when you “continue as guest” there should be no recommended recipes as you do not have an account</li>
                <li>All participants found the lack of wording and imagery confusing</li>
                <li>One participant felt there should be a CTA for guests to sign up</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h5>Suggestions</h5>
            <ul>
                <li> Create a screen where the drop down menu shows the contents of the hamburger icon</li>
                <li> Create a separate home screen for users who “continue as guests” prompting them to sign up</li>
                <li> Participants did not understand the “rough prototype” as they have never seen one before</li>
                <li>I could add a CTA on the home screen for users to be encouraged to signup</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
    <picture><img src="img/images/iphone-a.jpg" alt="Iphone A"></picture>
    <picture><img src="img/images/iphone-b.jpg" alt="Iphone B"></picture>
    <p>Originally I had chosen a red color to be used for all buttons but was unsure if it was more pleasing to the eye to have a brighter color. 18 participants were shown two different screens from the design, showcasing slight differences such as the color of buttons and the outline box. The participants were to choose on their own accord the design they felt worked best.  They were able to provide feedback or remain anonymous via the link provided to take the test.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>Mockups</h2>
    <picture><img src="img/images/mockups.jpg" alt="Mockups"></picture>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This UI/UX design demonstrates a comprehensive approach to delivering a user-centric solution. Low and high-fidelity wireframes laid the foundation for iterative feedback and design improvements, while mockups and responsive design ensured the solution's adaptability across various devices. User interviews, user testing, and A/B preference tests provided invaluable insights, allowing the design to be refined based on real user needs and preferences. The result is a well-rounded, user-friendly design that meets both the client's objectives and users' expectations.</p>
